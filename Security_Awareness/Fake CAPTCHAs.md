**Why am I receiving this message?**

- Fake CAPTCHAs have been involved in recent ransomware attacks.

**What is a CAPTCHA?**

- A CAPTCHA, or “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”, is a challenge that some websites use to verify if the user is a human or a bot. It is used to prevent spam and other various automated functions that a bot may bring to the website. 

**What do I look out for?**

- After you click the “I am not a robot” check mark, the fake CAPTCHA will secretly add a script or some sort of code to your clipboard. It will then tell you to press the Windows + R keys, press the ctrl + v keys, and then hit enter, which runs malicious code. 

- Remember that a real CAPTCHA would never have you run commands.

**What do I do if I run into a CAPTCHA that asks me to run these commands?**

- Close out of the page you are in and contact the IT Department immediately.
