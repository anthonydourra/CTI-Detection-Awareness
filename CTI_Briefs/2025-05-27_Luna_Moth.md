## Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel Queries

Execution of Remote Access Tools (XDR):

    DeviceProcessEvents
    | where FileName has_any ("ZohoAssist.exe", "AnyDesk.exe", "Splashtop.exe")
    | project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InititatingProcessFileName

Exfiltration Tools: WinSCP or Rclone (XDR)

    DeviceProcessEvents
    | where FileName has_any ("winscp.exe, "rclone.exe")
    | project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName

User executes suspicious file from Downloads folder (XDR)

    DeviceProcessEvents
    | where FolderPath has "\\Downloads\\"
    | where FileName has_any (".exe", ".js", ".vbs", ".ps1")
    | where InitiatingProcessFileName has_any ("chrome.exe", "msedge.exe", firefox.exe")
    | project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName
